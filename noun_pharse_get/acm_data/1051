This problem requires that you implement Ohaver's encoding algorithm. The input will consist of several messages encoded with Ohaver's algorithm. The first line of the input is an integer n that specifies the number of test cases. The following n lines contain one message per line. Each message will use only the twenty-six capital letters, underscores, commas, periods, and question marks. Messages will not exceed 100 characters in length.
