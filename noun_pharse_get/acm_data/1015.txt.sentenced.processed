The input file contains several jury selection rounds.
Each round starts with a line containing two integers N and M.
N is the number of candidates and M is the number of jury members.
These values will satisfy 1<=N<=200, 1<=M<=20 and of course M<=N.
The following N lines contain the two integers PI and DI for I = 1,...,N.
A blank line separates each round from the next.
The file ends with a round that has N=M=0.
