The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of devices in the communication system, followed by n lines in the following format: the i-th line (1 ≤ i ≤ n) starts with mi (1 ≤ mi ≤ 100), the number of manufacturers for the i-th device, followed by mi pairs of positive integers in the same line, each indicating the bandwidth and the price of the device respectively, corresponding to a manufacturer.
