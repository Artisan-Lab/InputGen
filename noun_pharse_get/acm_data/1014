Each line in the input file describes one collection of marbles to be divided. The lines contain six non-negative integers n1 , . . . , n6 , where ni is the number of marbles of value i. So, the example from above would be described by the input-line "1 0 1 2 0 0". The maximum total number of marbles will be 20000. The last line of the input file will be "0 0 0 0 0 0"; do not process this line.
