The first line of the input file contains two integers N and K, separated by spaces, where N is the number of coins (2<=N<=1000 ) and K is the number of weightings fulfilled (1<=K<=100). The following 2K lines describe all weightings. Two consecutive lines describe each weighting. The first of them starts with a number Pi (1<=Pi<=N/2), representing the number of coins placed in the left and in the right pans, followed by Pi identifiers of coins placed in the left pan and Pi identifiers of coins placed in the right pan. All numbers are separated by spaces. The second line contains one of the following characters: '', or '='. It represents the result of the weighting:''>' means that the weight of coins in the left pan is greater than the weight of coins in the right pan,'=' means that the weight of coins in the left pan is equal to the weight of coins in the right pan.
