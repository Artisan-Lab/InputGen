The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The data for each test case consists of a pair of programs. Each program is written as a sequence of consecutive lines, each line containing exactly one command. Programs end with a line containing only the word END. You may assume that no variable in any program is named 'END'. There is no blank line between programs of one test case. There are at least one and at most 25 lines in each program. Total number of variables in two programs is no more than 10.
