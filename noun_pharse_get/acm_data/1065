The input consists of T  test cases. The number of test cases  (T)  is given in the first line of the input file. Each test  case  consists  of  two  lines: The  first  line  has  an  integer  n ,  1 <= n <= 5000 ,  that  represents  the  number  of wooden  sticks  in  the  test case, and  the  second  line  contains  2n  positive  integers  l1 ,  w1 ,  l2 ,  w2 ,..., ln ,  wn , each  of  magnitude  at  most 10000 ,  where  li  and  wi  are  the  length  and  weight  of  the  i th  wooden  stick, respectively. The  2n  integers are delimited by one or more spaces.
