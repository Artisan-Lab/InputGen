The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case consists of three integers W, H, and n (1 ≤ W, H ≤ 100). W is the width, and H is the height of the grid in terms of the number of grid points. n is the number of pieces on each board. The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n pairs of integers xi , yi, giving the coordinates of the pieces on the first board (0 ≤ xi < W and 0 ≤ yi < H). The third line of the test case describes the coordinates of the pieces on the second board in the same format.
