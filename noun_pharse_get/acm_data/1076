Input contains several complete or partial games.  A game is described by a single line with a single name, not to exceed 12 characters, and sequence of numbers, one for each ball thrown indicating the number of pins still standing after that throw,ended with -1. According  to the rules, there are from 11 to 21 throws in a game; no input line will show throws beyond the last throw of the game.  The number of games described in a file is not predetermined, so you'll have to detect the end of the input file.
