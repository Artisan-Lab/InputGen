The input consists of   T test cases. The number of  test cases  (T )  is given  in  the  first  line of  the  input  file. Each  test  case  consists  of  two  lines: The  first  line  contains  a  natural  number  n ,  not  greater  than  5, which implies  you  are  given  a  (complete  or  incomplete)  n*n  grid  as  input,  and  the  second  line  begins  with  a nonnegative integer  k , the number of matchsticks that are missing from the complete  n*n  grid, followed by k numbers specifying the matchsticks. Note that if  k  is equal to zero, then the input grid is a complete  n*n grid; otherwise, the input grid is an incomplete  n*n  grid such that the specified  k  matchsticks are missing from the complete  n*n  grid.
