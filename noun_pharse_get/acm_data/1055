You are to write a program to read a data set of 5-digit zip codes, one per line, until end of input.  Your program should count the number of 5-digit bundles, 3-digit bundles, and first class letters.  You should include as many letters as possible in 5-digit bundles first, then as many as possible in 3-digit bundles, with as few bundles of 10 to 15 letters as possible. For example, if there are 31 letters with the same zip code, they must be combined into exactly three 5-digit bundles.  Not all zip codes in the data set will be valid.  A valid zip code consists of exactly 5 digits (0-9), all of which cannot be 0.  Non-numeric characters are not allowed.  At the end of your output, print the invalid zip codes found.  (Duplicates need only be printed once.)
