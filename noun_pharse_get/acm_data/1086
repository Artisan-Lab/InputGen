You will be given a number of cases in the input. The first line of input consists of a positive integer indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line containing n, followed by the quadtree encoding of the test image and the quadtree encoding of the secret image to be decoded. Each quadtree encoding starts with a line containing a positive integer m indicating the number of leaf nodes in the tree. The next m lines are of the form: k intensity which specifies that the node numbered k is a leaf node with the specified intensity as the associated leaf value. Nodes not specified are either internal nodes or absent in the quadtree. You may assume that all intensities are between 0 and 255, inclusively. You may also assume that each quadtree encoding is a valid output obtained from the encoding lgorithm described above.
