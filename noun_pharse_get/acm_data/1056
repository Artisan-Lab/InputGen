Write a program that accepts as input a series of groups of records from standard input.  Each record in a group contains a collection of zeroes and ones representing a binary code for a different symbol.  Each group is followed by a single separator record containing a single 9; the separator records are not part of the group. Each group is independent of other groups; the codes in one group are not related to codes in any other group (that is, each group is to be processed independently).
