Write a program that reads a series of data sets representing a computer file structure.   A data set ends with a line containing a single *, and the end of valid data is denoted by a line containing a single #.  The data set contains a series of file and directory names.  (The root directory is assumed to be the starting point.) The end of a directory is denoted by a ']'  Directory names begin with a lower case 'd' and file names begin with a lower case 'f'  File names may or may not have an extension (such as fmyfile.dat or fmyfile).  File and directory names may not contain spaces.
