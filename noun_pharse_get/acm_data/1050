The input consists of an N * N array of integers. The input begins with a single positive integer N on a line by itself, indicating the size of the square two-dimensional array. This is followed by N^2 integers separated by whitespace (spaces and newlines). These are the N^2 integers of the array, presented in row-major order. That is, all numbers in the first row, left to right, then all numbers in the second row, left to right, etc. N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the array will be in the range [-127,127].
