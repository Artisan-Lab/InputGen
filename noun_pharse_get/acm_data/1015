The input file contains several jury selection rounds. Each round starts with a line containing two integers n and m. n is the number of candidates and m the number of jury members. These values will satisfy 1<=n<=200, 1<=m<=20 and of course m<=n. The following n lines contain the two integers pi and di for i = 1,...,n. A blank line separates each round from the next. The file ends with a round that has n = m = 0.
