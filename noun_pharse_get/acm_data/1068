The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case is an integer n (1 <= n <= 20), and the second line is the P-sequence of a well-formed string. It contains n positive integers, separated with blanks, representing the P-sequence.
