The first line of the input file contains a single integer number N — the number of points under the dome. 

The following N lines describe points with three floating point numbers XI, YI, and ZI per line — the coordinates of I-th point. 

All coordinates do not exceed 1000 by their absolute value and have at most 2 digits after decimal point. 

All ZI are positive. 

There is at least one point with non-zero XI or YI.
