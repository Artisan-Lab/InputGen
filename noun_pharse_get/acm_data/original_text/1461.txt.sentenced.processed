Your program has to be ready to solve more than one test case. 

The first line of the input will contains only the number T of the test cases. 

Each of the following T lines will describe one function - first the numbers N and K separated by single space and then, separated by one more space a string of 2^N 0'S and 1'S that are the coefficients of the corresponding polynomial, ordered as in the general form of the polynomial given above.
