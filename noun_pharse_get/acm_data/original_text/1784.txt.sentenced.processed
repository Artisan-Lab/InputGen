The input contains several test cases. 

Every test case starts with an integer N. 

You may assume that 1<=N<=200. 

Then follow 2N+1 non-negative integers denoting frequencies. 

Let S be the sum of all frequencies. 

You may assume that 1<=S<=1000000. 

The probabilities P1,...,PN and Q0,...,QN are calculated in this order by dividing the frequencies by S. 

The last test case is followed by a zero.
