The input contains several floor descriptions. 

Every description starts with the number N of vertices that bound the floor . 

The next N lines contain two integers each, the X and Y coordinates for the N vertices, given in clockwise order. 

All vertices will be distinct and at corners of the polygon. 

Thus the edges alternate between horizontal and vertical. 

A zero value for N indicates the end of the input.
