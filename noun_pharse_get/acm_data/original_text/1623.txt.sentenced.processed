Input will consist of multiple problem instances. 

Each instance will start with a single line containing two integers N and M, indicating the number of rows and columns in the image. 

The maximum values for these integers is 128. 

The next N lines will each contain M characters representing the image to process. 

A black pixel will be represented by a '1', and a white pixel will be represented by a '0'. 

The input line 0 0 will terminate input and should not be processed.
