The first line of input contains the two integers N and M where 0 < N, M <= 500. 

The next line contains P, the number of vertices in the polygon, where 3 <= P <= 8. 

Each of the next P lines contains two integers X and Y where 0 < X < N and 0 < Y < M, specifying the vertices of the polygon. 

The vertices are listed in clockwise order. 

You may assume that the polygon does not intersect itself, and that no three consecutive vertices are colinear.
