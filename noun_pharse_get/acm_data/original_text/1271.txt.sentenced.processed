The input will contain no more than 10 test cases. 

Each test case begins with a line containing three integers N,K and H . 

A piece of bread is guaranteed to be a convex polygon of N vertices. 

In the following N lines, each line contains two integers XI and YI, representing the Cartesianism coordinate of the ith vertex. 

The vertices are anti-clockwise numbered. 

The test case containing N=0, K=0, H=0 will terminate the input, you should not give an answer to this case.
