The first line of the input file contains two integer numbers N and M, where N is the number of vertices in the graph , M is the number of edges in the graph . 

The following M lines describe edges of the graph, each edge is described by two integers AI, BI â€” the vertex numbers connected by this edge. 

Each edge is listed at most once. 

The graph in the input file is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.
