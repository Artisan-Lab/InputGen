The input consists of several blocks. 

The first line of each block contains a single number P, 1 <= P <= 100 000. 

P is the number of posts which have been built. 

Each of the following P lines contains two integers X and Y, 0 <= X, Y <= 10 000, which represent coordinates of the posts in MFF internal units . 

No two posts have the same coordinates. 

Each block is followed by a single empty line and the input is terminated by a line containing a single number 0.
