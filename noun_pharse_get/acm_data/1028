Input is a sequence of commands. The command keywords BACK, FORWARD, VISIT, and QUIT are all in uppercase. URLs have no whitespace and have at most 70 characters. You may assume that no problem instance requires more than 100 elements in each stack at any time. The end of input is indicated by the QUIT command.
