Write a program which will determine whether or not numbers are cyclic. The input file is a list of integers from 2 to 60 digits in length. (Note that preceding zeros should not be removed, they are considered part of the number and count in determining n. Thus, "01"is a two-digit number, distinct from "1" which is a one-digit number.)
