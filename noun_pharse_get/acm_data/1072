The first part of the input file is a dictionary of English words common to all test cases. The first line of the file is d (1 <= d <= 50000); the number of words in the dictionary, followed by d lines each containing a word in the dictionary. The words in the dictionary are sorted in alphabetical order and all are in uppercase. Each word has at most 20 characters, but you can assume that sum of the length of all words in the dictionary is no more than 350,000. The next line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. Each test case, which is preceded by a single blank line, consists of multiple lines in the input file forming the encrypted text. Each line has a string containing only uppercase letters and blank. You may assume that no line break is occurred in the middle of a word and there may be arbitrary number of blank characters at the end of each line. Maximum length of input lines is 80.
