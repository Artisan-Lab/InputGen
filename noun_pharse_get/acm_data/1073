To describe positions, we assume the coordinates are expressed as (x, y) and the origin lies in the top-left of all pipes and links. (Note that y coordinates are increased downwards). All coordinates are integer numbers between 0 and 100, inclusive.The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case is p (1 <= p <= 20), the number of pipes, followed by p lines, each describing a pipe. Each pipe description line consists of three numbers. The first two are (x, y) coordinates of the upper-left corner of the pipe and the third number is the height of the pipe (at least 1 cm and at most 20 cm). Note that diameter of each pipe is 1 cm.After input data describing the pipes, there is a line containing a single integer l, which is the number of links (0 <= l <= 50). After it, there are l lines describing links. Each link description contains 3 integers. The first two are (x, y) coordinates of the left end-point of the link and the third is the length of the link (at least 1 cm and at most 20 cm). It is assumed that the width of the link is zero.The last line for each test case contains two numbers. The first is the number of target pipe (starting from one, with the order appeared in test data). The second line is the desired y for the level of water in the target pipe (note that the specified level may be out of the pipe at all).You can assume the following about the input:.	The water enters into the first pipe..	No link crosses a pipe..	No two links have the same y coordinates..	No two pipes have the same upper-left x coordinates..	Both endpoints of each link are connected to pipes.
