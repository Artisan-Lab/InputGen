The input contains a sequence of data sets, each specifying a dimension and three shadow patterns.  The first line of a data set contains a positive integer 1 <= n <= 20 that specifies the dimensions of the input patterns.  The remainder of the data set consists of 3n lines, each containing a string of n "X" and "-" characters.  Each group of n lines represents a pattern.  Where an "X" appears a shadow should be cast by the final solid, and where a "-" appears, light should pass through.  For this problem, the input patterns may be assumed to have at least one "X" along each edge of the pattern.  The input is terminated by a line containing a single zero in place of a valid dimension.
