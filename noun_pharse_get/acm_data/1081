The school records include information about these student friendships, represented as lists of numbers.  If there are 29 students, then they are represented by the numbers 1 to 29.  The record for a single student includes, first, his/her student identification number (1 to 29, in this example), then the number of his/her acquaintances, then a list of them in no particular order. So, for example, this record 17 4 5 2 14 22 indicates that student 17 knows 4 students: 5, 2, and so on.  The records for all the students in the incoming class are represented as the list of numbers that results from concatenating all the student records together.  Spaces and line breaks are irrelevent in this format.  Thus, this 1 1 2 2 1 1 is a whole database, indicating that there are only two students in the incoming class, and they know each other; and this 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 indicates that 1 doesn't know 2, and 3 doesn't know 4, but all other pairs know each other. The database has been checked for consistency, so that if A knows B, then B knows A.
