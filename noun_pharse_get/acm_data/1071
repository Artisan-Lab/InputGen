The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case contains two integers m and n, which are the number of rows and columns of the grid respectively (1 <= m, n <= 100). Next, there are m lines, each containing n integers which are either 0 or 1, indicating whether the corresponding cell of the grid is empty (0) or occupied by an obstacle (1). After description of the field, there is a sequence of lines, each corresponding to a chase trip of Tom (in order). Each line contains two positive integers which together specify the range of steps Tom has taken (inclusive), followed by a single upper-case character indicating the direction of the chase trip, which is one of the four cases of R (for right), L (for left), U (for up), and D (for down). (Note that these directions are relative to the field and are not directions to which Tom turns). This part of the test case is terminated by a line containing exactly two zeros.
