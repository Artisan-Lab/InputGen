The input will consist of one case. The first line will be an integer n (0  <= n <= 30) specifying number of interior walls, followed by n lines containing integer endpoints of each wall x1 y1 x2 y2 . The 4 enclosing walls of the pyramid have fixed endpoints at (0,0); (0,100); (100,100) and (100,0) and are not included in the list of walls. The interior walls always span from one exterior wall to another exterior wall and are arranged such that no more than two walls intersect at any point. You may assume that no two given walls coincide. After the listing of the interior walls there will be one final line containing the floating point coordinates of the treasure in the treasure room (guaranteed not to lie on a wall).
