The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. Each test case consists of a single line, containing s (1 <= s <= 25), the length of the hexagon's side, followed by n, the number of triangle types (1 <= n <= 10), followed by n integers representing the length of each triangle type's side (between 1 and 25, inclusive).
