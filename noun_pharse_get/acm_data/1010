The input for your program will be pairs of positive integer sequences, consisting of two lines, alternating until end-of-file.  The first sequence are the available values of stamps, while the second sequence is a series of customer requests.  For example:1 2 3 0	; three different stamp types7 4 0		; two customers1 1 0		; a new set of stamps (two of the same type)6 2 3 0	; three customersNote: the comments in this example are *not* part of the data file; data files contain only integers.
