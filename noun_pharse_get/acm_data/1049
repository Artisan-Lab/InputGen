The input will consist of several lines of exactly 256 hex characters. Each line is the contents of memory, beginning with address 00 and ending with address FF. The end of the input is indicated by a memory state that has a stop instruction (an "8") at address 00. The input programs will never "fall of the end of memory" that is, you will never execute an instruction that is located between addresses F0 and FF, inclusive.
