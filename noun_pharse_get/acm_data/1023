The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. Each test case is given in three consecutive lines. In the first line there is a positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 64). In the second line of a test data there is a string of length k, composed only of letters n, and p, describing the Fun number system for that test data, where each n (p) indicates that the bit in that position is a negabit (posibit).The third line of each test data contains an integer N (-2^63 ≤ N < 2^63), the number to be represented in the Funk numbersystem by your program.
