Input  will start with a set of less than 1000 die throws which you must use for all games, starting each new game with the first player "throwing" the first number in the set, the next player "throwing" the second number, and so on.  This set of die throws will simply be a list of random numbers between 1 and 6, separated by single spaces, with not more than 80 characters on each line.  It will be terminated by the number 0.  After this set of die throws, there will be one or more game sets.  Each game set is in three parts.  The first part is a line containing a single number giving the number of players in the game.  This will be more than 1 and less than 6.  Then the board is described, in two parts. The first part lists the ladders and the chutes on the board, each ladder or chute being defined on a single line.  Each is given by two numbers, from 1 to 99,separated by one or more spaces.  The first number gives the start square, and the second number gives the end square; so it is a ladder if the first number is less than the second number, and a chute if the order is the other way.  The chute/ladder definitions are terminated by a line containing two 0's.  The second part of the board description gives the lose-a-turn/extra-turn squares, if there are any.  These are single numbers, one per line, defining the squares.  If the number is negative, its positive counterpart is a lose-a-turn square; if positive, it represents an extra-turn square.  (For example, -16 means that square 16 on the board is a lose-a-turn square, while a 25 means that players landing on square 25 must immediately roll again.)   The end of this set of descriptions, and of the game description, is given by a single 0.  The end of all the game descriptions is given by a game with the number of players equal to 0.
