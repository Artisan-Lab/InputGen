Circuits in the input will obey the following guidelines:1.        The maximum size of the circuit picture is 100 by 100 characters.2.        A path always travels in a straight line unless altered by a junction. At a junction, the path can and will make a ninety degree turn. Two junctions will not be horizontally or vertically adjacent.3.        No paths will be "broken" That is, every path character is guaranteed to be adjacent on both sides to either another path character of the same type, a junction, a gate input, a gate output, a logic input, or the logic output.4.        Circuit paths do not cross or intersect other paths.5.        Gate inputs always approach horizontally from the left as shown above. Gate outputs always leave horizontally to the right as shown above.6.        Inversions may only appear immediately adjacent to a gate input or output, and will always be preceded (in the case of an input) or followed (in the case of an output) by at least one dash as shown above.The end of a logic diagram in the input is indicated by line containing only a single asterisk in the first column.  Following this are several lines which indicate the state of the inputs in the logic diagram.  Each of these lines is a string of twenty-six "0"(zero) or "1"characters, with the first position representing the state of input A, the second position representing the state of input B, etc.  Note that input values which are not actually used in the circuit may simply be ignored.  The list of input states is terminated by a line containing only a single asterisk character in the first column.Following the asterisk which terminates the list of input states is another circuit diagram followed by a list of input states, which is then followed by another circuit diagram and list of input states, and so on until the end of the file.  The file will always contain at least one circuit and one set of inputs for that circuit.
