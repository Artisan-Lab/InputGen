The first line of the input contains two integers N and M, separated by a space ( 2 <= N <= 100 ,0 <= M <=100  ). The second line contains N pairs of integers X1, Y1, ..., XN, YN, separated by spaces, that represent Bob's route. The third line contains M pairs of integers X1',Y1',...,XM',YM', separated by spaces, that represent interesting places. All points in the input file are different and their coordinates are integers not greater than 1000 by the absolute value.
