The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. In the first line of each test case there is an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), that indicates the number of the wheel vertices. In each of the next n lines, there is a pair of numbers which are x and y coordinates of the initial position of a vertex. After this, there is a single line containing the initial x and y coordinates of the center of gravity of the wheel. You can assume that the center of gravity is inside or on the boundary of the polygon (note that the given center of gravity is not necessarily computable from wheel's geometric shape). Next lines of the test data will describe the shape of the hill. The surface of the hill is approximated with a series of line segments with decreasing slopes ending with a horizontal line segment. For each segment, there is a line containing length and slope of a segment (both of them are real numbers). The lines are ordered in decreasing slope (The last line of this part of the input has slope zero). You can assume that the last (horizontal) line is long enough that the wheel would not pass its end. In the last line of the test case, there is a line containing the x and y coordinates of the right end-point of the first segment. All coordinates and slopes are real numbers.
