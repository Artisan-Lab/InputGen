The first line of the input file contains two integers N and K separated by a space(1 <= K < N <= 10000).Then K lines follow, each of them describes one file. The description of the i-th file starts with the integer Si that represents the number of clusters in the i-th file (1 <= Si < N). Then Si integers follow separated by spaces, which indicate the cluster numbers of this file on the disk in the natural order.All cluster numbers in the input file are different and there is always at least one free cluster on the disk.
