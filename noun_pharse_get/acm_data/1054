Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains two integers R and C, respectively the number of rows and columns in your rice paddy, 1 <= R,C <= 5000.  The second line contains the single integer N, the number of flattened rice plants, 3 <= N <= 5000.  Each of the remaining N lines contains two integers, the row number (1 <= row number <= R) and the column number (1 <= column number <= C) of a flattened rice plant, separated by one blank. Each flattened plant is only listed once.
