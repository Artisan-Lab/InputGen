The first line of the input file consists of a single integer D (1 <= D <= 5), denoting the number of silicon plates. D blocks follow, each describing one silicon plate. The first line of each block contains three integers N (1 <= N <= 150), M (1 <= M <= 10), K (0 <= K <= MN) separated by single spaces. N is the length of the plate, M is its height and K is the number of bad squares in the plate. The following K lines contain a list of bad squares. Each line consists of two integers x and y (1 <= x <= N, 1 <= y <= M) ?coordinates of one bad square (the upper left square has coordinates [1, 1], the bottom right is [N,M]).
